This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU

# About me
I'm a Masters of Public Policy and Management student at Carnegie Mellon Heinz College.

I have a B.S. in Physics from Harvey Mudd College and have had a career in engineering, IT, and finance. Now my focus is to data analytics to shape public policy. My area of interest is in drug policy, especially as it relates to crime, addiction, and mental health treatment. Simply put, I want to change our country's relationship to drugs.

# What I hope to learn
I'm hoping to learn cutting edge visualization tools that I can use to enhance my ability to reshape the narrative around drugs and drug policy. To shape policy you have to be able to frame a compelling narrative to policy makers, and the facts alone are often not enough. Facts must be packaged in a digestible format that summarises the main ideas and is displayed in a way that resonates with your audience.

I would like to expand my toolset to be able to make more compelling visualizations that help me tell that story, as well as learn the subtleties that make data visualizations effective or not effective.
